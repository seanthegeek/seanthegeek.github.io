Back in 2016, I ran a website called TweetFreq.net. It would take any Twitter
username, load up the 3,200 of of that account's last Tweets, and output a
frequency graph of how many tweets the account posted per day, along with a
list of the most frequently used words in those tweets, and a word cloud image
based on that list. The site had to be shut down in 2023 after Elon Musk
acquired Twitter, renamed it X, and started charging $100/month for the APIs
that were used by TweetFreq. Thanks Elon. However, I ran that analysis on
Donald Trump's @realdonaldtrump Twitter account in 2019, saved the images, and
promptly forgot about them...until now!

First, let's look at the frequency graph.

TweetFreq retrieved the days when a tweet was posted. he averaged posting 10
tweets per day, with the maximum number of tweets per day being 34 in
November 2018. Some of those may be from staffers of course, but anyone who has
seen Trump's Twitter timeline knows there is a deference in grammar and
tone when it comes to Trump's tweets â€” he clearly wrote or dictated almost all
of them.

The word cloud is made up of the top 300 most frequently used words. The more
often a word is used, the larger that word will be in the word cloud.
What strikes me about the word cloud is similar it is to Trump's speech today.
Great is the largest word. Lots of references to himself in the third-person
(president, Trump, @realdonaldtrump). Immigration, border, etc. Keep in mind
that this covers 2018, the second year of Trump's presidential
term, when the [Mueller special counsel investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation) was in full swing, so collusion and
which show up. Even my home state of Ohio makes an appearance.

The only remaining question is: Does this word cloud qualify as art?
