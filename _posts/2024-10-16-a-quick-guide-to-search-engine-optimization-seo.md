Almost all of the posts on this blog are related to information security and other
technical topics. In general, I only write posts about [politics](/categories/politics/)
to cover topics that are not being covered elsewhere. Recently, I published
[a post](/posts/hova-laudon-spouts-false-anti-lgbt-conspiracy-theory-to-justify-evangelical-control-of-public-education/)
about a State of Ohio Board of Education candidate. That post has been ranked very high in
both Google and Microsoft Bing when searching for her name. At the time of this writing,
it is the first, third (via Reddit) and fourth result on Google, and the fourth result
on Microsoft Bing. Despite the fact that my post ranks at the top on Google, I actually
think Microsoft Bing does a better job returning relevant results, because the
candidate's official campaign website and Facebook page are the top two results there,
which is what I would expect to see as a curious voter. Those aren't included in the
Google results at all! Before anyone accuses me, Google, or Microsoft of some sort of
Big Tech conspiracy, I'd like to explain why that post is ranked so highly in search
engines, and how to leverage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) on your own website or
blog posts.

## Provide detailed information about a topic people want to know about

When I wanted to know more about the candidate, I searched for her name and found her
campaign website. The website consisted mostly of one sentence talking points
without specifics on exactly what she meant or why she took those positions,
which is what I really wanted to know. Those details were included in a YouTube video
on her campaign website. Website search engines don't index the content of videos, so
there wasn't much content for a search engine to index. This lack of indexable content
is likely why the campaign website preformed so poorly on Google. If you find that
Google isn't indexing your website, visit the
[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)
to find out why, and how to fix it.

To write my blog post, I watched that entire video, manually transcribed the parts of
the video that mentioned policy word-for-word, and included that in the blog post.
I also included my own commentary, but I made sure to mark the transcriptions
as [blockquote](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote)
elements to make the separation between quotes and commentary clear for both readers and
search engines.

## Use a descriptive title that contains important search terms

Try to keep the important search terms near the beginning of the title, rather
than the end. That way they won't get cut off when search results are displayed
to the user.

Blog and content management systems will include the title in the post URL and
top-level heading.

## Include search terms as part of the post content

Include search terms as a part of the post content, but only do it where it fits
naturally. Don't repeat terms over and over again just for the word count.

## Provide alt-text for all images

Alt-text is used to describe images for visually impaired people for visually impaired
people who use screen readers. It is also used by search engines to understand what the
images are. Search engines reward sites that use alt-text on images related to post
content with higher rankings.

## Provide a featured image and post meta description

Blogging and content management platforms allow you to set a featured image
(with alt-text) and description that will that will display in social media
previews of your post. This another place to naturally include search terms
or words related to them.

## Use headings to break up content where appropriate

Headings help your readers find the content they are looking for, especially in longer
posts like this one. Headings also provide the opportunity to add related keywords.

## Add internal and external links

When you are mentioning a related topic, add a link to another site or page on your own
site that provides more details. However, never make the keyword your are targeting
part of the link text. For example, I'm not including the word SEO in the link
below:

> Yoast provides SEO [plugins](https://yoast.com/) for WordPress and Shopify that give SEO advice as you create content.

## Get external sites to link to your content

As your content gets popular more people will link to it. Consider sharing your content
with popular communities. For example, I shared my post about the Ohio Board of Education
candidate to the [/r/Ohio](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1g3s1ew/ohio_school_board_candidate_spouts_a_false/)
subreddit. However, don't go overboard and spam various places with links.

## Site rankings get better with age

I have been writing this blog since 2016, filling it with lots of useful guides that
others have linked to. That gives my blog a better reputation than a site that was
created within the past year or two, such as new campaign websites.

## Different search engines rank things differently

Although my blog post appeared at the top of Google and Microsoft Bing results just by
searching for the candidate's name, this did not happen with DuckDuckGo or Yahoo. The
post ranked ninth out of ten in first page of DuckDuckGo results when only searching
for the candidate by name. The post was ranked first on DuckDuckGo when adding LGBT to
the search query. This was acceptable because my main goal was to inform voters about
the lie she spread about LGBT people. Unfortunately, that same `name LGBT` query on
Yahoo placed the blog post near the bottom of the forth page of results.
