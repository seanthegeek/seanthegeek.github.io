title: How the Parler data was legally acquired by activists
description: The Parler data dumps you've heard about were obtained legally by taking
  advantage of Parler's shoddy architecture. Here's how they did it.

Based on published source code and conversations with the woman behind the
Parler dump ([donk_enby](https://twitter.com/donk_enby) on Twitter), I can
completely explain how the Parler data was acquired, and why it was legal. The
story making the rounds on Reddit claiming that she somehow hacked Parler and
got admin access is third-hand bad techno-madlibs fiction. What she actually
did was reverse-engineer the protocol (API) used by the Parler iOS app to
communicate with the website backend.

An Application Programming Programming Interface (API) is the way services and
websites allow other apps and websites to interact with it. For example,
Twitter has an API that allows users to use other services like marketing
platforms to manage their Tweets. Likewise, Facebook has an API that lets
advertisers manage their campaigns. APIs are also used by mobile apps to
interact with the backend services that power the platforms they use.
Nowadays, most APIs are built on HTTPS, the same protocol that's used to
securely access websites. APIs can be public (allowing anyone to interact with
them), semi-public (allowing only registered users), private (access requires
specific credentials), or a combination where different actions are protected
at different levels.

By examining the Parler iOS app, donk_enby discovered that the Parler API
allowed anyone with a Parler account to view raw post data, including posts
that were deleted by their authors. When a user deleted a post (known as a
parlay), the website wouldn't actually delete the content. Instead, it would
flag the post as deleted in the backend. The website and apps would hide these
"deleted" posts. This kind of soft-delete is a common best-practice on many
social media sites, so that even if a user deletes a post, those in charge of
running the site can review deleted content for violations of website
policies. Unlike other social media platforms, Parlor made huge architectural
mistakes. When **any** user queried the API for a list of posts, the API
returned all posts, both published and deleted. Standard best-practice
development is to hide restricted content from those who are not authorized to
see it, no matter what method of used to access the content, including APIs.
Instead, Parler's developers relied on the website or app UI to not display
the posts the API indicated were "deleted". This lack of
[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
in the API led to a
[sensitive information exposure](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)
vulnerability. The API
did not put a limit on the number of queries that could be executed in a given
time frame, allowing anyone to retrieve information at a rapid pace.

Static files such as photos and videos were stored in an Amazon S3 bucket with
a sequential naming convention that made the files easy to enumerate. This
content and the URLs linking to them remained active even after a user soft-
deleted their post. Parler further exposed user information by not stripping
the metadata in user's uploaded media files before hosting them, including GPS
location coordinates that a frequently added by smartphones when taking photos
or videos.

The metadata in these files can easily be viewed using a free tool like
exiftool, such as in this screenshot [posted by](https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1348294151712944128/photo/1)
donk_enby.

Using Google Maps, it is an [easy task](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
to convert those coordinates, showing that this particular video was recorded
at [a location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/38%C2%B042'00.7%22N+75%C2%B010'11.3%22W/@38.7002,-75.1719887,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d38.7002!4d-75.1698)
inside the General Store in Marshtown, Delaware.

Retrieving this information is not illegal. In a textbook case of [security through obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity),
Parler's shoddy design allowed any Parler user account to access all of this
information via an undocumented API without bypassing or breaking any security
controls. The proper security controls were simply not implemented by Parler's
developers in the first place.

donk_enby wrote Python scripts that leverage Parler's API just like the iOS
app would. She shared the scripts on GitHub on December 7th, 2020, in a
cleverly-named repository called [parler-tricks](https://github.com/d0nk/parler-tricks).

In the README file, she notes:

Use it to solve fun mysteries such as:

* Is my dad on Parler?
* Who was on Parler before it first started gaining popularity when Candice Owens tweeted about in December 2018?
* Which users have administration and moderation rights? (hint: `(interactions >> 5) & 1` = moderator, `(interactions >> 6) & 1` = admin)
* What exactly is an "integration partner", and which media entities currently are they?
* If Parler is really yet to come up with a business model for how to make money, then what exactly is a Campaign Promoter Management Network?

She also sites a section of the DCMA that protects her from DCMA violation
claims resulting from publishing the scripts.

In the wake of the US Capital riots that were
[organized in part](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online)
by Parler users, Amazon gave Parler 24 hours notice that it
would [stop providing hosting services](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws),
for failing to consistently remove calls for violence in a timely manner
for years. Researchers and activists used donk_enby's scripts to quickly
archive nearly all of Parler's content -- [30 TB in size](https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1348778814910980098)
-- before Amazon took the website down.

Location data from photos and videos of the riots allowed Gizmodo to pinpoint
[how disturbingly far](https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905) rioters advanced inside the Capital. This
data will clearly make the FBI's task of identifying rioters and those
inciting violence much, much easier.

[Archiveteam](https://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Parler) and
[Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/parler-com?tab=about) (unrelated to
each other) are each building their own archives of Parler content, which
should be public soon.

Even if Parler manages to find a new host for the toxic platform, and adds
RBAC and rate-limiting to their API, they cannot remove the API entirely
without breaking the mobile applications for those who would still use them --
potentially reducing their userbase in the process.

Parler users seem to be moving to Gab, another upstart social media platform
full of disinformation and anger, but one that is much better built.

**Update** : Ironically, shortly after the above statement was posted, Gab was
the victim of [a data breach](https://www.wired.com/story/gab-hack-data-breach-ddosecrets/).
Parler has since come back one line, and
[briefly blocked](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/parler-bans-former-ceo)
its ex-CEO. Apparently, fascists aren't good at AppSec.
