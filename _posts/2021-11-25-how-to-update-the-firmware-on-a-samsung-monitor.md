    USB Device Found Check Device And Try Again. I formatted an old USB 2 thumb drive
    to Fat 32 and only copied the unzipped .bin file to it. That still did not work.
    I then connected a USB extension to the service port...Voila! success!  Note:
    I also turned off the USB Super Charging feature on the monitor, so I''m not sure
    if that had anything to do with it. Hope this helps'

  content: "On Samsung lu28r550 model with a joystick:\r\nUpgrading the Software via
    USB \r\n1 Connect a USB memory to the SERVICE port shown in the figure\r\n\r\nWhen
    the screen is on, press the JOG button to display the Function Key Guide. Move
    down to power icon. Press and hold the JOG button down for approximately 5 seconds.
    \ Down is not press into monitor, but towards you, like trying to select an icon
    below the power icon.\r\n \r\n2 When the message \"Do you want to update via USB\"
    is displayed on the product, select Yes to upgrade the software.\r\n\r\n3 When
    the screen asks to upgrade from version xxx to version yyy, select Yes\r\n\r\n4
    The software upgrading proceeds.\r\n \r\n5 Your product will turn itself off and
    on again automatically after completing update, and then turn off your product.
    \r\n \r\n6 Remove the power cord from the power outlet and then reconnect the
    cord after turning off\r\n \r\nNote \r\n1 To perform software upgrade by using
    a USB memory, first format the USB memory to FAT32. \r\n \r\n2 When performing
    upgrade, make sure that only one BIN file (.bin) is saved in the root directory.
    \r\n \r\n3 To upgrade the software for the UR55 model, make sure the upgrade files
    are .bin formats. The file name should follow the naming conventions for the UR55
    model (e.g. M-R55**UGDA-****.*[fourdigit number].bin). The ** is the screen size
    in inches, the ****.* is the version number, and the four-digit number is the
    checksum. For example, &ldquo;M-R5528UGDA-0804.0[1899].bin&rdquo; conforms to
    the naming conventions for the UR55 28\" model and should be copied to the root
    directory.\r\n \r\n4 If the No valid update files found. Please check your USB
    device and try again. message is displayed, this is probably due to the following
    reasons\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n A USB memory is not connected to the SERVICE port. \r\n‒
    The files in the connected USB memory are not compatible formats.\r\n‒ There are
    no valid upgrade files found in the connected USB memory. (There are no upgrade
    files saved in the memory or the file names are incorrect.) \r\n \r\n5 Do not
    turn off the product. And prevent the upgrading from any interruption as far as
    possible. In general, the product returns to the previous version if an upgrade
    is interrupted.\r\n \r\nNOTE: Make sure that the USB is empty  to avoid file corruption
    while installation is on process."

  content: "This guide helped me find the right thing to do for my Samsung monitor.
    \ Other guides talk about pressing the Middle button and long pressing Down.  That
    did NOT work for my monitor.  For mine, this guide, where it says \"Use the little
    joystick under the monitor to navigate to Menu> Support> Software Update.\" ->
    That was the trick.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a difference between a firmware update,
    and a software update on my monitor?  On my monitor, pressing the middle button
    and long-pressing down does something, but it ends with a message: \"Software
    Update - No update files found on your USB device.  Please check your USB device
    and try again. (File name: Novatek     ****)\"\r\n\r\nSo, the software update
    through the menu stem worked.  Trying the trick with the middle button, then long-press
    down, doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAlso, the long press down states that it's looking
    for a \"Novatek     ****\" filename.  There's no reference of Novatek anywhere
    on the web.  I even renamed my .bin file to \"Novatek     E078.bin\" (and then
    later also without the \".bin\".  Didn't work.\r\n\r\nWithout the correct filename,
    the monitor's menu option \"Update software\" gave the error but asked for the
    correct filename: \"M-A8U27SGZA\" (MAN was I pleased to see that.  Lost a day
    on this).\r\n\r\nWhen I changed the filename back to exactly what it was in the
    .zip download, it all worked."

Almost every device you can buy nowadays has upgradable firmware. New firmware
versions can fix bugs, patch security vulnerability, improve features, or add
features. As computer monitors get more complex and feature-packed, it becomes
more important to use the latest firmware. Samsung doesn't provide
instructions on performing a firmware update in user guides on on download
pages. This guide explains the exact steps for updating the firmware on
Samsung monitor, and will hopefully save you a lot of searching.

## What you will need

* A Samsung monitor
* A flash drive that you you don't mind completely erasing
* An internet connection

## Check the monitor model and current firmware version

Use the little joystick under the monitor to navigate to Menu> Support>
Information. This will display:

* The full model number
* The serial number
* The software/firmware version
* HDR status
* Adaptive Sync status
* Active port
* Display resolution
* Refresh rate

## Acquire the firmware

To download the latest firmware for your monitor go to the Samsung
[support](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/) website, click search for your
model number, and enter your model number. Click on manuals and software.
Under firmware, click download.

Extract the .img firmware file from the downloaded ZIP.

## Prep the flash drive

Warning: This process will erase all data on the flash drive!

The flash drive needs to be formatted with a FAT32 filesystem. The easiest way
to do this is to use the free an open source drive flashing tool,
[Rufus](https://rufus.ie).

![Screenshot of Rufus](/assets/images/rufus-gui.png)  
Rufus is a simple GUI utility for flashing drives

Plug in the flash drive, then run Rufus. Apply the following settings:

* Device: The drive you want to format
* Boot selection: Non bootable
* Partition scheme: MBR
* Target system: BIOS or UEFI
* File system: Large FAT32 (Default)
* Cluster size: 32 kilobytes

Click START, read the warning, and click OK.

![Screenshot of a warning from Rufus](/assets/images/formatting-warning.png)  
Rufus will warn you before taking action

You might need to unplug the drive and reconnect it before it will appear
again.

Rufus will add the files `autorun.ico` and `autorun.inf` to the flash drive.
Delete these files.

![A screenshot of the files created by rufus](/assets/images/rufus-autorun-files.png)  
Rufus creates these files to add an icon to the drive label

Copy the .img file you extracted earlier to the flash drive.

Eject and remove the flash drive.

## Connect the flash drive

Before connecting the flash drive, unplug all USB devices that are connected
to the monitor, **including any USB type B cable** between the monitor and
computer.

Plug the flash drive into the USB Type A port labeled Service. Same Samsung
monitors have two USB Type A ports, but only one of those ports is a service
port that can be used to upgrade firmware.

![Diagrams of the ports on Samsung monitors](/assets/images/samsung-monitor-ports.png)  
Some monitors only have a service port. Others have multiple USB ports, with
only one port as a service port.

## Start the update

Use the little joystick under the monitor to navigate to Menu> Support>
Software Update. Once the update is finished, you can unplug the flash drive
and reconnect any USB devices you disconnected before the update.
