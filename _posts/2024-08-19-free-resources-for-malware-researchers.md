Many free data sources can provide useful information about malware samples they
have already seen. They can be queried by file hash or other IOC.
**Do not upload samples to public tools**, such as VirusTotal or public
sandboxes. These tools allow others to download samples, which may include
sensitive data. Instead, build your own sandbox using CAPE, or use a
commercial sandbox service with a contract that protects the confidentiality of
your data.

And obviously, be extra careful when handling malware.
