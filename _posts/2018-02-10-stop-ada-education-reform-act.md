  requirements until a notification is sent by a disabled person, and denies persons
  with disabilities their right to due process through the courts, shifting the burden
  of compliance from businesses to the disabled

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (amended in 2008) is a
bipartisan law that sets accessibility standards that businesses open to the
public must follow, so that those with disabilities can work, shop, dine, and
play just like any other citizens. Title III of the ADA requires basic
necessities like ramps, handicap parking spaces, and doorways wide enough for
a wheelchair. Even under current law, the accommodations must not place an
"[undue burden](https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12181)" on the
business, and be "[readily
achievable](https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12181)". In other words,
the accommodations must be practical and affordable. As a result of 27 years
of building access equality, these features have become so ubiquitous that
it's easy for anyone to take them for granted. However, the enforcement
mechanism that has been in place for nearly three decades is now in jeopardy
because of [H.R.620](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-
bill/620) \- The ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017, sponsored by [Rep. Poe,
Ted [R-TX-2]](https://www.congress.gov/member/ted-poe/P000592).

Currently, if a business does not meet the basic accessibility standards that
have been established in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for 27
years, they can be sued under Title III of the ADA to compel the business to
comply with the law. There are no financial penalties -- the plaintiffs can't
shake businesses down for money. Businesses in violation of the ADA are only
required to bring their property into compliance with the law, and repay the
plaintiff's attorneys fees.

## What would the ADA Education and Reform Act do?

The ADA Education and Reform Act would require the the Department of Justice
to set up a new program to educate state and local governments and business
owners of their obligations under ADA. However, federally-funded nationwide
ADA training, education, and assistance [already exists](https://adata.org/).
The education piece is a smokescreen for the reform part of the legislation,
which adds more red tape to the process for those requirements to be enforced,
while opening loopholes for businesses to avoid compliance and litigation
entirely.

Before an ADA Title III lawsuit could be initiated. a disabled person
(referred to in the law as an "Agitated Person") must notify the business of
the specific violation, including citing the exact provision of ADA Title III
that is being violated. Therefore, an impacted disabled person must either:

* Become a self-taught expert on ADA Title III requirements
* Rely on non-profits that are already overworked
* Pay an attorney out-of-pocket, with no way to recover legal fees

After receiving notification, the business would have 60 days to acknowledge
the violation, and another 120 days to make "substantial progress" towards
remedying the violation. **Businesses would have no obligation to be
accessible until such a complaint is received.** Even then, as the ACLU
[mentions](https://www.aclu.org/blog/disability-rights/congress-wants-change-
americans-disabilities-act-and-undermine-civil-rights), this time period could
be **extended indefinitely** , as long as the business claims to continue to
be making "substantial progress" towards a remedy, denying people with
disabilities their right to obtain a court order to enforce compliance with a
27 year old law.

## How would this affect disabled people?

> Force and other civil rights organizations [wrote][1] in opposing this bill,
> "We know of no other law that outlaws discrimination but permits entities to

## What can I do to help stop this bill?

Call, mail, and/or email your elective representatives, and let them know that
you oppose H.R.620 - The ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017. Here are some
points to mention:

* The ADA Network already provides ADA training and education; setting up an additional education program at the Department of Justice is unnecessary and wasteful
* Under current law, the accommodations must not place an "[undue burden](https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12181)" on the business, and be "[readily achievable](https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12181)", and plaintiffs cannot seek financial damages beyond recovering legal fees
* The proposed legislation allows business to ignore ADA requirements until a notification is sent by a disabled person, undermining the spirit of the ADA that all public businesses must be accessible from the start
* The proposed legislation would deny persons with disabilities their right to due process through the courts, by allowing businesses to indefinitely delay enforcement of the law through continuous claims of "substantial progress"
* The proposed legislation shifts the burden of compliance from businesses to the disabled, many of whom do not have the resources to issue a proper notification without a path of recovering legal fees
