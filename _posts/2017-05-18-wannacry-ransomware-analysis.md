The WannaCry ransomware worm has spread panic and destruction as it infects
hundreds of thousands of systems around the world; a rate not seen since the
[Blaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_\(computer_worm\)) and
[Sasser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasser_\(computer_worm\)) worms of
2003. WannaCry -- also known as WannaCrypt, WannaCryptor, WanaCrypt0r, WCry,
or WCrypt -- leverages vulnerabilities that Microsoft patched in the March
[MS17-010 Security Bulletin](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-
us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx), after taking the unprecedented step of
[canceling the February Patch Tuesday](https://arstechnica.com/information-
technology/2017/02/microsoft-cancels-february-patch-tuesday-despite-0-day-in-
wild/).

While collecting samples of WannaCry, I found a sample that predates the worm
version. The sample was compiled on February 9th, and uploaded to VirusTotal
on February 10th. While compile timestamps can be faked, the closeness to the
upload date suggests that the compilation timestamp is legitimate.

timestamp.png)

Malware authors will often upload their builds to VirusTotal as a lazy way of
testing against current versions of almost all anti-malware products, before
using the malware against their targets. VirusTotal allows security
professionals to search and download these samples through their paid
VirusTotal Intelligence subscription.

Through this service, I found that when the February sample was first
uploaded, only three anti-malware products detected the sample as malicious,
though only with generic/heuristic signatures. By March 12th, most major anti-
malware products detected this sample as some form of ransomware -- some
mistook it as a Locky variant. When WannaCry 2.0 began spreading as a worm on
May the 12th, the attackers had adjusted the malware so that only a few
products detected these new samples as malicious.

Fortunately, WannaCry samples to date have not been packed or otherwise
obfuscated. A few days after the initial worm outbreak, almost every anti-
malware software was updated in ways that detect all known variants of
WannaCry, but not before the ransomware [disrupted hospital care across the
UK](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/13/nhs-workers-and-
patients-on-how-cyber-attack-has-affected-them), and paralyzed hundreds of
other organizations worldwide. Of course, the attackers will eventually make
changes to avoid detection again.  This is a typical detection pattern for new
malware, which illustrates why any one product -- including "next gen"
products --  should not be relied upon on its own to keep a network safe.

A hacking group known as the Shadow Brokers reportedly stole a large cache of
weapons-grade exploits, tools, and data from the NSA. Microsoft released a
patch for some of those exploits a month before they were publicly released by
the Shadow Brokers, leaving many to speculate that Microsoft was tipped off by
the NSA. A month after the public Shadow Brokers dump, the authors of WannaCry
incorporated a SMB exploit from the dump to turn WannaCry into the most
widespread worm in over a decade.

This whole situation shows not only how dangerous widespread software
vulnerabilities can be, but how information security defenses and procedures
are fundamentally insufficient in many organizations. Those who were affected
by the WannaCry ransomware worm were **at least two months behind**  on
software patches rated by Microsoft as **critical**.

## Timeline

* 2017-02-10 -- First known sample of WannaCry is uploaded to VirusTotal
* 2017-02-17 -- Microsoft cancels patch Tuesday
* 2017-03-14 -- Microsoft posts the [MS17-010 Critical Security Bulletin](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx) and patches, including one for [a SMB flaw](https://www.rapid7.com/db/vulnerabilities/msft-cve-2017-0143)
* 2017-04-14 -- The Shadow Brokers leak multiple exploits reportedly stolen from the NSA, including one that exploits the SMB flaw patched in MS17-010
* 2017-05-12 -- WannaCry 2.0 begins spreading as a worm by using the SMB exploit
* 2017-05-12 -- Microsoft releases [customer guidance](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/) for WannaCry and emergency patches for unsupported versions of Windows, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
* 2017-05-16 -- The Shadow Brokers [announce](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/shadow-brokers-warn-of-june-data/) a "subscription service" coming in June for receiving future data leaks, and claim to have 75% of the U.S. cyber arsenal

Despite the availability of patches and updated anti-malware signatures,
ransom money continues to flow to the attackers throughout the day. There are
three known Bitcoin wallet addresses where victims are directed to send ransom
payments:

* 115p7UMMngoj1pMvkpHijcRdfJNXj6LrLn
* 12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw
* 13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94

At the time of this writing, these wallets combined have received a total of
46.30 Bitcoin, which is worth about $86,447.80 based on a 24-hour average
exchange rate of 1 BTC â‰ˆ $1,867.01 USD. The ransom amounts range from
$300-$600 per system.

Reports indicate that [North Korea](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-
way/2017/05/16/528587064/north-korea-may-be-linked-to-wannacry-ransomware-
researchers-say) may be using WannaCry to fund its weapons programs as it
faces tightening international sanctions and isolation.

## The kill switch implementation is odd

In some ways, having a kill switch for a worm makes sense. If something
horribly unexpected happens with your code -- e.g. it crashes a system 50% of
the time -- you may want to kill the worm before it can brick half of your
potential targets. What's odd about WannaCry's kill switch is that it simply
checked for the registration of a predetermined domain name, which lead one
researcher to register it, [not
knowing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/13/accidental-hero-
finds-kill-switch-to-stop-spread-of-ransomware-cyber-attack) it was a kill
switch. It stopped the worm in its tracks, until the attackers launched a
version without a kill switch. These seem like lazy development choices.
WannaCry was already using asymmetric encryption; why not use that to verify
the kill switch server?

## Speculation on WannaCry's initial infection vector

One of the remaining questions around WannaCry is: How do the attackers
initially get the malware to run on a system in a network? There was some
initial speculation in the information security community that a phishing
campaign was employed. However, days after the malware outbreak, a phishing
lure has not been identified, making such a scenario increasingly unlikely.

The vulnerable protocol exploited by WannaCry is SMB, which is mainly used to
share files and administer systems on a local network. While most networks
block outside SMB traffic, a [quick search of
Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=port%3A%22445%22+%21os%3A%22Unix%22+%21product%3A%22Samba%22+before%3A19%2F05%2F2017+after%3A18%2F05%2F2017)
(It's like Google, but it indexes services exposed to the internet. not web
pages) reveals that there are at least 80,441 Windows systems with SMB
services exposed to the internet, a good number of which are bound to be
unpatched. The number varies from day to day. Although this number has likely
decreased somewhat from when WannaCry 2.0 was first released, as organizations
mitigate the worm threat, it would only require one vulnerable server to gain
access to a network. From there, it would be trivial to pivot to other systems
on the LAN.

## Lessons from WannaCry

  1. Patch early, patch often
  2. Monitor and restrict services open to the internet
  3. Create regular out-of-band backups, and test restoration

_Note: A previous version of this article referenced 1,202,995 Shodan results
for Windows systems with exposed SMB. I have since learned that number
included past results, and was therefore inaccurate. The new results are
filtered to only include services that were active on 2017-05-18, the original
publication date of this article._
