This blog is intended to serve multiple purposes:

- A space to keep notes on the projects Iâ€™m working on, in the hope they will be useful for others (or at least to  myself ) in the future
- A place for me to share InfoSec knowledge with a wide audience of system administrators, developers, and students
- A place for me to geek out ðŸ™‚

I appreciate any feedback.
